                My name is Christopher D. Sharkey, but I go by Chris.  However, all of my friends and co-workers call me "Sharkey".  I am happily married to my beautiful wife, Brenda.  We have a 5 year old daughter and another baby on the way.  I graduated from Benedictine College with a double major in Business Administration and Spanish.  I currently work at Truman Medical Center at Hospital Hill as the Perioperative Data Analyst and Scheduling Coordinator.  I have been at Truman for 5 years now.  I am currently going back to school to get a dregree in Computer Science (more specifically, Software Develpment).  For some reason, I have been blessed with the ability to pick up and learn things relatively quickly, especially when dealing with computers and programs, so I figured, why not give it a shot?  It has always been something that I have been very interested in.<br><br>
        
                My main hobbies are; sports, playing with my daughter, and watching movies (altough I will soon be adding software developing and web designing to this list).  When I graduated highschool, I was offered a baseball scholarships to Rockhurst College and a football scholarship to Benedictine College.  However, since everyone was telling me that I was not big enough to play football at a college level, I wanted to prove them wrong so I took the football scholarship and played for the Benedictin Ravens.  My freshman year, I was the staring JV strong safety and 2nd string varsity.  My sophmore year, I got to travel with the team to Germany over the summer to play against a German semi-pro team.  However, all of this came to a hault mid junior year, when I went across the middle to knock down a pass and the wide receiver ran into my extended arm forcing it to rip backwards.  Althoug I tried to conitue playing, I was unable to lift my arm past my chest.  When I went to see the Dr. he said that I had partially torn three of the tendons in my arm and would either have to have surgery or quit playing.  I chose to quit playing. <br><br>
        
                My activities include; playing Tuesday night softball, school, work, doing work on our house (which we purchased 2 years ago), working on our cars, and speding quality time with my family.  During the week, we have a very busy schedule, but most Sundays, we go out and spend the whole day together.  We either take our daughter to the park, the movies, to Science City or Legoland.  We then finish the day off by going out for dinner.<br><br>
        
                I would like to finish with a funny story about my "nickname", I guess if you want to call it that.  While in college, my junior year, a friend of mine, which I had known and played football with since my freshman year, was in a class with me.  When the professor started to do role call, and he came to my name, he said "Christopher Sharkey?", I raised my hand and my friend looked over at me with a dumbfound look on his face.  After class, he came up to me and said, "Sharkey is your last name?  All of these years, I thought it was only a cool nickname.  At first I thought that the professors even called you by your nickname."
